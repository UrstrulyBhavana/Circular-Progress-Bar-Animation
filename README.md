The `setInterval` function increments the percentage and updates the progress bar:
```javascript
let number = document.getElementById("number");
let counter = 0;
setInterval(() => {
   if (counter == 65) {
      clearInterval();
   } else {
      counter += 1;
      number.innerHTML = counter + "%";
   }
}, 30);
```
